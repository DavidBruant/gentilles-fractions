# Front-end template

This repo is meant to be a template repo. Not useful in itself, but a starter kit for other projects

A simple theme is already set up

A JavaScript bundler with [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is set up

Continuous deployment is setup via Github Actions. The continuous deployement builds with `npm run build` then does a `git push origin online`, then triggers a github page build of the `online` branch

## Local dev

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
